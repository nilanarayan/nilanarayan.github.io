<p>
    This project is still in the works- it is the research work I am doing as I work towards my Masters in Engineering.
</p>

<p>
    The goal of the project is to observe and experiment with strain and vibration based coordination of custom-designed swarm robots. 
    I am currently designing the robots as well as a way for them to interact with a skin like membrane, detecting and acting upon continuous strain or short term strain 
    which causes vibrations- as a way to test algorithms to encourage group swarm behavior.

    This research is meant to be inspired by real life biological responses, such as in micro-organisms. In the future, it may be used to create smart fabrics or construction robots.
