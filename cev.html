<p>Cornell Electric Vehicles (CEV) is a fully student run project team dedicated to making as efficient and innovative 
    of an electric vehicle possible. In my final year on the team, we also introduced full autonomy-self driving as a goal of the team. 
    Over the course of 3 years, I served as a member of the mechanical autonomy team, then as a Drivetrain member and project lead as well as 
    the team's Manufacturing lead. And lastly, I served as the Mechanical Team Lead in my senior year. On the side, I also designed some merch, helped with 
    social media/recruitment and, oh yeah! Drove the car!

<h3>Leadership Responsibilities</h3>

<p>As the lead of the Mechanical team, I was in charge of over 30 students and responsible for the vehicle's chassis, drivetrain, steering system and autonomy initiative. 
    To keep things running smoothly, myself and project leads set up weekly system meetings and semesterly design reviews to provide consistent and widespread technical feedback. Members also got 
    individual feedback every few months to help them get the most out of the team. We also kept the team organized with both full-team and Mechanical GANTT charts. Lastly, I redesigned our CAD sharing system and our documentation protocols to push for more consistent documentation to aid future members.
</p>

<p>I also worked with the other team leads (Electrical, Software, Operations, Full Team Leads) to ensure smooth integration of all systems, testing procedures, and 
    organized the shipment of the vehicle for our yearly competition. Good cooperation skills were key to helping this team run!
</p>

<h4>Education/Onboarding Material</h4>

<p>
    A large part of my role as a team lead was managing the onboarding program for new members. I developed several onboarding workshops, including 
    an introduction to CAD, fundamentals of mechanical design, design for manufacturing, and more!
</p>

<p>In truth, though, we were all students. There are many ways I can think of wherein I learned from younger members of the team just as much as they learned from me,
     and I feel that maintaining that sense of equality is key in being a good leader.

<h3>Drivetrain - Motor Selection, Transmission+Differential</h3>

<p>I am very grateful to have gotten a chance to work on the team's very first "Urban Concept" vehicle for the Shell Eco Marathon Competition, a start contrast to the 
    much smaller, three-wheeled "Prototype Vehicles" they had been making for years before that. It was without a doubt the team's most ambitious move yet, started just as I joined the team.
</p>

<p>As a member and later co-lead of the Drivetrain subteam, I focused first on doing calculations to select the motor for the vehicle, and then on redesigning the Chain and Sprocket transmission not only to 
    optimize it for manufacturing (which was withoyt a doubt an extremely iterative process, even into the manufacturing phase!), but also for cost and weight.
</p>

<h4>Motor Selection Process</h4>

<p>Selecting the motor meant not only doing calculations on the motor torque, wheel RPM, and other physical characteristics needed to power the vehicle through the 10-mile race- but also working with and 
    electrical specifications and limits that had to be met.

<h3>Carbon Footprint Reduction</h3>
<p>For submission for an award in the 2024 Shell Eco-Marathon, I wrote a proposal for a Carbon-Footprint reduction plan involving having the team 
    use carbon fiber scraps to design carbon-fiber rims for a future vehicle which would not obly improve performance, but reduce waste.
