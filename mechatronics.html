<p>
    For the final project in MAE 3780: Mechatronics, we were tasked with creating a robot that ran on an Arduino microcontroller and autonomously 
    collected blocks while competing against another robot from our class. All the code was written in C, and we used a color sensor to determine what side of the 
    board we were on and prevent driving out of bounds. We also had laser-cut acrylic arms to help us hoard cubes.
